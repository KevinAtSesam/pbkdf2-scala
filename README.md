pbkdf2-scala - a pbkdf2 implementation in scala
===================================================

pbkdf2-scala is an implementation of pbkdf2 [1] in scala.

The current implementation is hardcoded with the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1) pseudorandom function. One can very easily change that.
